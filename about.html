                    with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias "Tokyo" as a man called the
                    "Professor" saves her from being caught by the police. He proposes to include her in a heist of
                    massive proportions. After a brief outline of the plan, the story jumps to the beginning of a
                    multi-day assault on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid.
                    The eight robbers are code-named for cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin,
                    Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits and masks depicting artist
                    Salvador Dalí, the robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with €2.4
                    billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location.
                    Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation at an abandoned hunting estate
                    in the Toledo countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal
                    relationships, and are warned that there will be casualties.</p>

                    their roles and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. While Denver pursues a
                    love affair with hostage Mónica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the National Police Corps
                    negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego
                    "Salva." The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered and Raquel eventually
                    realizes Salva is the Professor, but she is emotionally unable to hand him over to the police. At
                    the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape from the Mint with €984 million, but Oslo,
                    Moscow and Berlin are killed.</p>

                    Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations.
                    However, when Europol captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old
                    plans to assault the Bank of Spain to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and
                    Raquel get the gang, including Mónica, back together, and enlist three new members: Palermo, Bogotá
                    and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank,
                    take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets.</p>

                    group manages to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo attempts to reassert command by
                    colluding with Gandía, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gandía escapes,
                    begins communications with the police from within a panic room inside the bank, and participates in
                    a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo reverses course, regains the trust of the group,
                    and rejoins them. Gandía shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later
                    recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes to the
                    public the unlawful torture of Rio and Lisbon's detention and interrogation. Sierra is fired and
                    begins pursuing the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after
                    she is transferred from the command post tent to the Supreme Court building. Season 4 concludes with
                    Lisbon rejoining the gang inside the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, then
                    holding him at gunpoint.</p>

                    Helsinki sustaining a severe injury. Tokyo sacrifices herself to defeat Gandia and the soldiers.
                    Sierra runs away and the Professor chase after her. They soon become allies as they face their
                    common enemy - the police. The gold is stolen by
                    Rafael and Tatiana and they bury the gold. When Professor enters the bank, Tamayo interrogates each
                    gang member separately. 24 hours after the heist, the gang reunite at an air base.
